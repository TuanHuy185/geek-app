Technical Stack and Approach

1. Frontend Framework
- React 18: Latest version with improved rendering and concurrent features
- Vite: Modern build tool for faster development and optimized production builds

2. State Management
- Redux Toolkit: For centralized state management

3. Styling Solutions
- Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling
- Styled Components: For component-specific styled elements
- CSS Modules: For scoped styling

4. UI/UX Enhancements
- React Icons: For comprehensive icon library
- Lucide React: For consistent and customizable icons

5. Functionality and Features
- React Router DOM: For client-side routing
- React Toastify: For toast notifications

8. Development Tools
- ESLint: For code quality and consistency
- Postcss & Autoprefixer: For CSS processing and browser compatibility

Architecture Decisions:
1. Used Redux for global state (users, albums) while keeping Context API for simpler app-wide state
2. Implemented code-splitting through React.lazy() (implied by the setup)
3. Utilized Vite's module aliasing for cleaner imports
5. Implemented strict mode for better development practices
